    <p>According to a new report released by Assemblymember Alex Bores, electric bicycles, or e-bikes, are 19 times more likely to cause collision fatality than regular bicycles.  The report, entitled “Analyzing Electric Bike Safety in New York City”, examines available collision report data and to whom fault was attributed.</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
    <p>This comes on the heels of a public outcry over the death of Priscilla Loke, a 69-year-old school teacher who was struck by an e-bike and later died of her injuries. The cyclist has not been identified.</p>
</div>

<!--This is my pretty diagram showing that e-bikes are 19 times more likely than regular bikes to cause a fatal collision, that you helped me figure out yesterday!-->

<div class="container">
    <p>Unsurprisingly, cars were far and away the highest cause of fatalities, but the distinction of e-bikes being significantly more dangerous than regular bicycles has heralded calls for new legislation, as e-bikes and bicycles are currently regulated the same as one another. Bores proffers five conclusions that act as policy recommendations for future regulation.</p>

<h2>Conclusions:</h2>

<div class="flex">
    <div>
        <h3 class="icon_head">Mark <span class="yellow">e-bikes</span> on collision reports.</h3>
        <img src="images/registration.svg" alt="checkbox option on form">
        <p> There is currently no box on police collision reports to denote e-bikes, leading to incomplete data collection.</p>  
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3 class="icon_head">Create an <span class="yellow">e-bike</span> safety course.</h3>
        <img src="images/school.svg" alt="graduation cap">
        <p> The report recommends the DMV create a safety training for e-bike riders, and calls on food delivery companies to mandate it for their workers.</p>  
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3 class="icon_head">Ensure <span class="yellow">mopeds</span> are registered with the DMV.</h3>
        <img src="images/delivery-scooter.svg" alt="moped">
        <p> Mopeds, which are already required by law to be registered but are often not, also pose a danger to pedestrians. The report proposed requiring mopeds be registered before they leave the store.</p>  
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3 class="icon_head">Redesign <span class="yellow">streets</span> to be safer for all.</h3>
        <img src="images/bike-lane (1).svg" alt="bike lane on road">
        <p> Curb extensions are one of many traffic "calming" measures that reduce risk to pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers.</p>

    <div>
        <h3 class="icon_head">Review the regulation of <span class="yellow">e-bikes.</span></h3>
        <img src="images/law.svg" alt="gavel">
        <p> Legislators are called on to re-examine how e-bikes are classified and offer bills to help ameliorate the issue.</p>
